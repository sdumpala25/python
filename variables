VARIABLE:
A variable, as the name indicates is something whose value is changeable over time. 
In fact a variable is a memory location where a value can be stored. Later we can retrieve the value to use. 

x = 10
y = 3
x + 9 
_ + y ( We can use UnderScore for output of the previous operation )

name[1:] ( It will starts with 1 and go till the end )
name[:5] ( It will starts with first letter and end before 5 )

name[2:10] ( Its start with 2 and end at the last leeter of the string )

'one' + name[3:]

len(name)

IDENTIFIERS:

Identifier is the name we give to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. 
That means whenever we want to give an entity a name, thatâ€™s called identifier.
