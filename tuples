## Unlike list, tuples are immutable

## Creating tuples

# Empty tuple
my_tuple = ()
print(my_tuple)

# Tuple having integers
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)

# tuple with mixed datatypes
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
print(my_tuple)

# nested tuple
my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
print(my_tuple)

## Tuple Packing && Unpacking ( Creating tuple without using paranthesis is known as packing )

my_tuple = 3, 4.6, "dog"
print(my_tuple)

# tuple unpacking is also possible
a, b, c = my_tuple

print(a)      # 3
print(b)      # 4.6
print(c)      # dog

## Creating a tuple with one element ( We will need a trailing comma to indicate that it is, in fact, a tuple. )

# Creating a tuple having one element
my_tuple = ("hello",)
print(type(my_tuple))  

# Parentheses is optional
my_tuple = "hello",
print(type(my_tuple)) 

## Indexing

my_tuple = ('p','e','r','m','i','t')

print(my_tuple[0])   # 'p' 
print(my_tuple[5])   # 't'
